# Project: MiniRT

## üèÅ Goal üèÅ

The goal of the program is to generate images using the Raytracing protocol. Those computer-generated images will each represent a scene, as seen from a specific angle and position, defined by simple geometric objects, and each with its own lighting system.

## üöÄ Usage üöÄ

```shell
git clone git@github.com:nfauconn/miniRT.git
cd miniRT/Project
make
```

```shell
./miniRT <scene.rt>
```

Scenes examples are located in `scenes/`

If you want to create your own, here are the specifications:

- Each type of element can be separated by one or more line break(s).
- Each type of information from an element can be separated by one or more space(s).
- Each type of element can be set in any order in the file.
- Each element first‚Äôs information is the type identifier (composed by one or two character(s)), followed by all specific information for each object in a strict order such as:
- **Ambient lightning**:
	```
	A 0.2 255,255,255
	```
	- identifier: A
	- ambient lighting ratio in range [0.0,1.0]: 0.2
	- R,G,B colors in range [0-255]: 255, 255, 255
- **Camera**:
	```
	C -50.0,0,20 0,0,1 70
	```
	- identifier: C
	- x,y,z coordinates of the view point: -50.0,0,20
	- 3D normalized orientation vector. In range [-1,1] for each x,y,z axis: 0.0,0.0,1.0
       - FOV : Horizontal field of view in degrees in range [0,180]: 70

	- the sphere diameter: 12.6
	- R,G,B colors in range [0-255]: 10, 0, 255
- **Plane(s):**

## üìã Project Instructions üìã

### Rules

| | |
|--|--|
| Program name | miniRT |
Turn in files | `Makefile`, `*.h`, `*.c`
Makefile  | `NAME`, `all`, `clean`, `fclean`, `re` 
Arguments | a scene in format `*.rt`
External functs. | `open`, `close`, `read`, `write`, `printf`, `malloc`, `free`, `perror`, `strerror`, `exit` - all functions of the math library (`-lm man man 3 math`) - all functions of the MinilibX

### Graphics Library

For graphical display management and window manipulation, this project utilizes the `minilibX` graphics library. This library, specifically developed for students at √âcole 42, offers a straightforward interface for creating graphic windows and managing keyboard/mouse events.

### Common Instructions

- **Language**: The project must be written in C.
- **Norm Compliance**: Code must adhere to the Norm of the school.
- **Error Handling**: Programs should not exit unexpectedly (e.g., segmentation fault, bus error, double free). Such incidents will render the project non-functional and result in a score of 0.
- **Memory Management**: All heap allocated memory must be properly freed. Memory leaks are not tolerated.
- **Makefile Requirements**:
   - Must compile source files to the required output with flags `-Wall`, `-Wextra`, and `-Werror`.
   - Must not relink.
